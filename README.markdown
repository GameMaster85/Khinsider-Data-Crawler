#KHInsider album downloader

This is a PHP script I wrote to get all the songs from an album on KHInsider. The site doesn't allow you to download full albums for free- it asks for a "Server donation". Each music file is hosted within a separate page in each album, so it's very time consuming to go to each song's page and download it. This is the solution.

Here's the blog post I wrote about it: [*A tumblr post*](http://ollieoblivious.tumblr.com/post/6360673677/the-cowboy-bepop-soundtrack) by [Oliver Song](http://olli.es)
